## Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Ahmed. I have a strong interest in software development and I'm currently focused on becoming a full-stack engineer through continuous self-study and structured learning.

I come from a small village in Egypt and have been passionate about technology since I was young. Despite limited resources, I've worked hard to develop my skills and now I am building projects, learning GitHub, and contributing to the tech community.
